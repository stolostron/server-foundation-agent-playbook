# Upstreams

The repos are forks of repositories from organizations like `stolostron`, `open-cluster-management-io`, and `openshift`.

The `ocm`, `cluster-proxy`, `managed-serviceaccount` repos' upstream is `open-cluster-management-io`.

The `release` repo upstream is `openshift/release`.

Other repos' upstream is `stolostron`.

# Branches and versions

The default branch of these repositories is usually the `main` branch, but some repositories have `master` as their default branch.

For repositories forked from `stolostron`, in addition to the `main` branch, there are branches for previous releases following the naming pattern `backplane-2.x`.

The currently active `stolostron` release branches range from `backplane-2.4` to `backplane-2.9`.
